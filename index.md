## General introduction

Hi! My name is Anya. I am a second year Computer Science major. 
I am also an international student from Russia. I am most excited
about Software Engineering, AI and Cybersecurity. However, I still
don't know a lot of things, so I am very open to any learning opportunity
that comes my way. My interests (besides Computer Science) are different
types of sports like swimming and snowboarding, drawing and sketching,
traveling and trying out new hobbies in general.

My family has 2 pets. They mean a lot to me so I thought that I would share about them on this page too:
