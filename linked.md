## Quote

When I think about my favourite quotes there aren't a lot of examples
that wouldn't sound pretencious, so I will just share the one that doesn't
have a connection to my life, but I was very fascinated by: 

> “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”

by J. Robert Oppenheimer, but originally coming from Hindu scripture.

This quote is very concise, but is able to infinite human potential
in a beautiful way. It shows the freedom and power to both create and destroy
that we as humans have, and it's simultaneously mesmerizing and terrifying.
