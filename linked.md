## Quote

When I think about my favourite quotes there aren't a lot of examples
that wouldn't sound pretencious, so I will just share the one that doesn't
have a connection to my life, but I was very fascinated by: 

> “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”

by J. Robert Oppenheimer, but originally coming from Hindu scripture.
This quote is very concise, but is able to depict human endless potential
to both create and destroy in a beautiful way.
